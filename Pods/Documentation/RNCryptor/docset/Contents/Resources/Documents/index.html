						<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Encryptor/Decryptor for iOS</p>

<p>Provides an easy-to-use, Objective-C interface to the AES functionality of CommonCrypto. Simplifies correct handling of
password stretching (PBKDF2), salting, and IV. For more information on these terms, see ~!@<a href="http://robnapier.net/blog/aes-commoncrypto-564">&ldquo;Properly encrypting with AES
with CommonCrypto,&rdquo;</a>@!~ and <a href="http://iosptl.com">iOS 5 Programming Pushing the Limits</a>, Chapter 11.
Also includes automatic HMAC handling to integrity-check messages.</p>

<p><a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> is immutable, stateless and thread-safe. A given cryptor object may be used simultaneously on multiple
threads, and can be reused to encrypt or decrypt an arbitrary number of independent messages.</p>

<h1>Use</h1>

<p>The most common in-memory use case is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>NSData *data = [@"Data" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSError *error;
NSData *encrypted = [[RNCryptor AES256Cryptor] encryptData:data password:@"password" error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>This generates an <code>NSData</code> including an encryption salt, an HMAC salt, an IV, the ciphertext, and an HMAC. To decrypt this bundle:</p>

<pre><code>NSData *decrypted = [[RNCryptor AES256Cryptor] decryptData:encrypted password:@"password" error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>The same encryption and decryption can be processed from one <code>NSURL</code> or <code>NSStream</code> to another to minimize memory usage:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL result = [[RNCryptor AES256Cryptor] encryptFromURL:plaintextURL
                                                  toURL:ciphertextURL 
                                                 append:NO 
                                               password:password 
                                                  error:&amp;error];

BOOL result = [[RNCryptor AES256Cryptor] decryptFromURL:ciphertextURL
                                                  toURL:plaintextURL
                                                 append:NO 
                                               password:password 
                                                  error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<h1>API Documentation</h1>

<p>Full API information is available at <a href="http://rnapier.github.com/RNCryptor/doc/html/Classes/RNCryptor.html.">http://rnapier.github.com/RNCryptor/doc/html/Classes/RNCryptor.html.</a></p>

<p>Details on the data format are available at <a href="https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor/wiki/Data-Format.">https://github.com/rnapier/RNCryptor/wiki/Data-Format.</a></p>

<h1>Building</h1>

<p>Comes packaged as a static library, but the <code></code>RNCryptor<code>.h</code> and <code></code>RNCryptor<code>.m</code> files can be dropped into any project.</p>

<p>Requires <code>Security.framework</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Mac support should be possible, but requires replacing <code>SecCopyRandomBytes()</code> and switching from AES-CTR to AES-CBC (at least in 10.7).</p>

<h1>Design considerations</h1>

<p><a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> has several design goals, in order of importance:</p>

<h2>Easy to use correctly for most common use cases</h2>

<p>The most critical concern is that it be easy for non-experts to use <a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> correctly. A framework that is more secure, but requires a steep learning curve on the developer will either be not used, or used incorrectly. Whenever possible, a single line of code should &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; for the most common cases.</p>

<p>This also requires that it fail correctly and provide good errors.</p>

<h2>Reliance on CommonCryptor functionality</h2>

<p><a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> has very little &ldquo;security&rdquo; code. It relies as much as possible on the OS-provided CommonCryptor. If a feature does not exist in CommonCryptor, then it generally will not be provided in <a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a>.</p>

<h2>Best practice security</h2>

<p>Wherever possible within the above constraints, the best available algorithms are applied. This means AES-256, HMAC+SHA1, and PBKDF2:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>AES-256. While Bruce Schneier has made some interesting recommendations regarding moving to AES-128 due to certain attacks on AES-256, my current thinking is in line with Colin Percival here: <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-07-31-thoughts-on-AES.html.">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-07-31-thoughts-on-AES.html.</a> PBKDF2 output is effectively random, which should negate related-keys attacks against the kinds of use cases we&rsquo;re interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>HMAC+SHA256. No surprises here.</p></li>
<li><p>Encrypt-then-MAC. While <code>RNCryptor</code> does not exploit all the advantages of this approach (for instance, by design it cannot validate the HMAC prior to decrypting the stream), I still believe the Encrypt-then-MAC approach makes sense. For more discusion, see <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac.html.">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-24-encrypt-then-mac.html.</a></p></li>
<li><p>PBKDF2. While bcrypt and scrypt may be more secure than PBKDF2, CommonCryptor only supports PBKDF2. NIST also continues to recommend PBKDF2. <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage</a> We use 10k rounds of PBKDF2 which represents about 80ms on an iPhone 4.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Code simplicity</h2>

<p><a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> endeavors to be implemented as simply as possible, avoiding tricky code. It is designed to be easy to read and code review.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Performance is a goal, but not the most important goal. The code must be secure and easy to use. Within that, it is as fast and memory-efficient as possible.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>Without sacrificing other goals, it is preferable to read the output format of <a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> on other platforms. It would be nice if the format were easy to read or write in PHP or Java. Similarly, it would be useful if <a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> could read and write common formats like OpenSSL&rsquo;s <code>enc</code> output. While OpenSSL has significant problems in how it implements AES encryption (for instance, it does not iterate its KDF), it is very common and it would be useful if <a href="Classes/RNCryptor.html"><code>RNCryptor</code></a> could integrate into systems that use it.</p>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<ul>
<li>v1.0 is complete and includes synchronous stream and data support.</li>
<li>v1.1 will include the option of OpenSSL compatibility (at the cost of reduced security and removal of integrity checks). This may cause small cahgnes in the API</li>
<li>v1.2 will add asynchronous modes. This may cause non-trivials changes in the API.</li>
</ul>
